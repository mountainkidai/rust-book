# rfSE Club - rust Playground

Welcome to the rust Playground! This presentation is a customized edition of [_The Rust Programming Language_](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) adapted to fit our club's first-principles centric approach. Our goal is to make rust more accessible for everyone.

## Note

incase you want a quick recap, we would recommend you to go through rfSE Docs - Programming/rust/concepts. But if you want to learn from basics, stick to rust Playground.

## 1. Interactive Quizzes

Each chapter features quick quizzes designed to reinforce your understanding as you read. Please:

1. Take the quizzes as soon as you encounter them.
2. Avoid skipping quizzes to maximize learning.

Try the sample quiz below by clicking "Start" and see how you do.

{{#quiz ../quizzes/example-quiz.toml}}

If you get a question incorrect, you can choose to retry the quiz or see the correct answers. We encourage you to retry until you score 100%. Feel free to review content before retrying. After viewing correct answers, retries are disabled.

If you spot an issue in a quiz or elsewhere, please file it on our GitHub repository: <https://github.com/mountainkidai/rust-book>

## 2. Highlighting

You can select any text, highlight it, or leave comments by clicking the ✏️ button that appears on selection.
