# rfSE Club Rust Learning Experiment

Welcome to the rfSE Club's interactive Rust learning experiment! This presentation is a customized edition of [_The Rust Programming Language_](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) adapted to fit our club's learner-centric approach. Our goal is to make Rust more accessible and engaging for developers at all levels.

## 1. Interactive Quizzes

Each chapter features quick quizzes designed to reinforce your understanding as you read. Please:

1. Take the quizzes as soon as you encounter them.
2. Avoid skipping quizzes to maximize learning.

Try the sample quiz below by clicking "Start" and see how you do.

{{#quiz ../quizzes/example-quiz.toml}}

If you get a question incorrect, you can choose to retry the quiz or see the correct answers. We encourage you to retry until you score 100%. Feel free to review content before retrying. After viewing correct answers, retries are disabled.

If you spot an issue in a quiz or elsewhere, please file it on our GitHub repository: <https://github.com/mountainkidai/rust-book>

## 2. Highlighting

You can select any text, highlight it, or leave comments by clicking the ✏️ button that appears on selection.

👉 Try highlighting this text! 👈

Highlights help you save notes for yourself or provide feedback on confusing sections.
